      <h1>Avocado's: An American Article</h1>
      <p>With the surge of interest in the green fruit thanks to Millennials and their trendy obsessions, 
        the USA has demonstrated to be one of the countries that best showcases this phenomenon. And these
        visualisations will help to make their case. </p>

              boasting accumulated sales of 100 million and above. But this should come as no surprise as afterall, 
              the United States is the second largest producer of avocados after Mexico. </p>
              <p>Now if you look at the many
              regions that sell avocado's, California is the states supreme seller, hitting a tier of sales above eight
              figures. Goddamn. Well, other than California, which other places are doing well? Which regions are 
            making up America's 'top 10' of avocado salers?</p></td>

              California (obviously) are our top 10. Yes they boast great sales, but how do they prefer to sell it? With small bags?
              large bags? or the good ol' extra large? </p>
              <p>Generally, America is truly the nation of being large about everything, be it with their food, their 
                bodies, or their spirit (for better or worse). This notion bleeds into here too, with Americans 
              generally preferring to purchase avocado's in larger bags then smaller. Furthermore, the purchasing 
            of extra large bags of avocado's is quite prevalent too. </p>
          <p> So, bags are one matter, but so is the avocado type. What do they prefer? </p></td>

            <td><p> What's the difference between conventional and organic anyway? Were avocado's truly that binary
              in nature? Well no, this actually refers to the farming method implemented to grow these fruits. 
            Conventional farming uses chemical fertilizers to promote plant growth, while organic farming employs 
            the traditional manure and compost to fertilize the soil. Sure conventional is faster, but organic is 
          said to be healthier, with these avocado's containing more healtheir nutrients. </p>
        <p> But in spite of these healthier benefits, at no point in America's years from 2015 to 2018 do organic 
          avocado's outdo conventional avocado's in sales. In fact the sales of organic avocado's were near 
          non-existent come the start of 2018.  </p>
        <p> Now when the avocado is sold, it's stuck with a particular kind of receipt. What's the most prevalent? </p></td>

              PLU 4225 and/or PLU 4770. The product/price lookup (shortened to PLU) code serves to uniquely 
              identify a produce. And for avocado's, there are three in particular. 4046 identifies 
              non-organic small/medium Avocados, 4225 identifies non-organic large Avocados, and  
              4770 identifies non-organic extra large Avocados.    
            </p>
            <p> Looking at the chart,, it's a bit of an even split between PLU 4046 and 
              PLU 4225. Some regions showcase more purchasing of 4046, and others 4225. It is not clear that 
            either is dominant. At the very least, we definitely know that no common American purchases extra large
             avocado's on the daily. Wait, affordability. Yes, that is where we'll stop at next. </p></td>
